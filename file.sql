Alias Raycasting is like ray tracing in that we can compute volume intersections (fog, particles, glows, et. al.) with the speed of a 2D intersetion test, but unlike raytracing in that no secondary rays are (or can be) generated due to the nature of the geometry which is already projected into 2.5D.

Beginning in Oct 83, Digital Productions traded in the â€œolderâ€ Cray-1S for the very first Cray X-MP supercomputer. The Cray was fronted by a VAX 11/780 and was used to produce nearly 300 shots totaling 25 minutes of screen time. The team used E&S PS400\'s for modeling and IMI vector motion systems for motion preview with Ramtek frame buffers for display. When Triple-I had wrapped the TRON work and decided not to continue in the CG film business, DP leased the Digital Film Printer (DFP) and hooked it up to on of the high speed channels of the Cray. The Cray driven DFP could scan 35mm film at four seconds a frame, and film out the 2000x2560 rendered images at twelve seconds a frame.\nFor the first time, highly detailed computer generated images were integrated with live action as realistic scene elements, rather than as monitor graphics or deliberately â€œCGâ€ looking images. Gary Demos from the very begining always had the drive to only produce the highest resolution, highest quality imagery possible. \nKevin Rafferty(ILM) led the team that digitally encoded (modeled) many of the forms designed for the film by Ron Cobb. The technique used was to have top, front and side views of the model drawn orthographically on blueprint-like paper. A mouse/cursor (or â€œpuckâ€) with cross hairs would then be used to input the lines of the drawing, one point at a time.

Present were Rodney Stock (a hardware consultant), Jim Blinn (who worked at Lucas for a short time), Loren Carpenter, and Alvy Ray Smith.

They felt its days were numbered because of the ever increasing power and low cost of new general-purpose PCs. Ed chose, however, not to drop the hardware development business right away, mainly because the CAPS deal with Disney was entirely based on the Pixar Image Computer, and he did not want to leave them high and dry. Ed also knew it was only a matter of a time before they could port the CAPS development to the new SGI platform; it was just a matter of waiting it out while they continued to lose money. Just then, Ed received a call from one of their chief competitors in the image-processing market, a company called Vicom. Vicom was taking the position that to make that market more successful, all the competitors should join forces with one product. \"Would Pixar be willing to sell their hardware outright to Vicom?\" Ed: \"Let me think about that and get back to youâ€¦\" (Ed smiles to himself).

Sandin was a faculty member of the sculpture department, where he taught video and was involved with the making of electronically based, interactive, kinetic sculpture.

In the evenings, imagesâ€”manipulated using the GRASS system and analog processorâ€”were projected onto large video screens and shown on monitors to the accompaniment of live music.\n\"Real time,\" with respect to these performances, meant that the images changed instantaneously as the controls were manipulated. In effect, the performers \"played\" both musical instruments and visuals. The performances were improvisational in a variety of musical styles. Preparation involved not only technical and programming issues but extensive jamming. The interactivity of Interactive Electronic Visualization Event was supplied during the day when the audience could come and play with the equipment. Subsequently, the \"I\" was dropped, and EVE2 and EVE3 continued as performances, which were interactive for the performers but not for the audience.\nEVE1 was the prototype, establishing the possibility of such an event. EVE2 (1975) involved a lot more planning and quality control of content but was also held in the rotunda with live musical accompaniment. EVE3, in 1977, still emphasized the real-time possibilities of this medium. However, the performers felt that the logistics of organizing a complicated live performance and a large-scale physical event were beginning to interfere with aesthetic goals. Therefore, the performances were recorded in front of a small studio audience and were edited on a deck. The finished show took place in the auditorium of the First National Bank, and the computer graphics and sound were played back on a light-valve projector.

Vertigo began, unlike the startups that predominate our industry, as a company in a totally different field in search of solutions for which computer graphics was an excellent fit. Two real estate developers (Fred Daniels and Mike Parker) building prefabricated houses for the Asian market were looking for ways to communicate the complexities of assembling their product in the field in a clear, unambiguous way. Because their product sold into a variety of countries speaking different languages, a visual approach was ideal.\nA video production group was formed, and the bold idea of harnassing computer graphics to demonstrate the assembly of their product was adopted. In those days, there were no off-the-shelf animation systems one could buy, and computers powerful enough to render were still in the $500,000 price range or higher.\nBy 1982, development had begun on a scanline polygon renderer written by Steve White from the University of British Columbia. (Later, Steve became software architect for the Neo-Visuals animation systemâ€”a turnkey computer animation system that debuted at SIGGRAPH 1985 and had the interesting quality of being written in Fortan.) The computer was a VAX-11/750 that was \"borrowed\" at night from a timeshare company two floors upstairs.\nThe company hired artists who had to learn computer graphics on the job. Very soon, the company began work on computer animations for the Canada-wide market such as flying logos for national ad campaigns, instructional videos, and a memorable 30-second flythough of Vancouver for a local radio station. Time was billed at $1,000/second of finished work, and the upstairs computer with 4MB of RAM was churning images on a nighly basis.\nVertigo employed many animators, many of whom are still active in the industry. Matt Arrott went on to Silicon Graphics and later became Director of Engineering for Dreamworks. Rod Paul went to Rhythm & Hues and then DreamWorks. Kirk McInroy ended up at ILM. Nancy St. John (producer) went on to Digital Productions, ILM, and later worked on feature films such as Babe as an independent producer.\nIn 1983, Vertigo began development of a quadric surface constructive solid geometry renderer for its producton work.

The Cubicomp product, called PictureMaker, featured polygonal modeling, scene choreography, and rendering at a much lower price point than on comparable workstation-based software systems. At the time of the aquisition, the combined installed based totalled some 750 units worldwide.\nVertigo moved from the historic Pender Street office to a new modern office in the West End of Vancouver. The team was reinvigorated by the new office, excitement, and owners and quickly got back on track.\nIn 1988, the Vertigo product was rewritten to take advantage of the new RISC-based workstations from SGI (the 4D series). All 3D modules of the system were integrated with new extended functionality and enhanced workflow was provided. A new hardware product providing D1 and D2 video support, the VideoPak (with development led by Dave Dignam), was released. Boolean modeling and ray tracing were added in 1989. A notable advance for character animation purposes was the addition of free-form deformations that permitted animatable lattice deformations to be applied to static or animated objects. In addition to bend and twist deformations, the lattices also permitted arbitrary animation of lattice points to enact simple muscle bulging.\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,1,'2012-10-25 16:12:10','2012-10-25 16:12:12',NULL,NULL),(257,'Vertigo AFTER Cubicomp',3,NULL,'In 1990, out of the ashes of Cubicomp, a couple of ex-Vertigo employees and a group of investors purchased the code.

For a number of years the successes continued, as did the releases of versions. New features were added, and the team grew back to the size it was in the early days. In 1993, the decision was make to ditch the old renderer in favor of supporting the industry standard RenderMan. The team undertook this directly, creating a seamless link to RenderMan. An interface was created to allow easy interactive editing of shaders and renders to RenderMan without writing out the usual ASCII RIBs. Finally, this enabled Vertigo to break into the film market. Disney BVVE took the system along with a great deal of support from Vertigo. This relationship grew into Vertigo eventually producing shots for Disney movies in Vancouver. Even with this success and turning into a public company, Vertigo again began to run short of cash and lost its capability to compete with teams such as Softimage and Alias|Wavefront.

At Image West, David Seig engineered the VERSEFEX, a system in which full-color transparencies could be used as input. Digital oscillators and 3D perspective were incorporated to animate the same video parameters found in Scanimate. At Computer Image Corp., Ed Tajchman created the System IV, a true digital 3D animation system with accurate perspective and digital keyframing. Its input, however, was still monochrome video, and it carried a price tag of around a million dollars. The System IV was used in production (by this author) at Editel in Hollywood from 1983 to 1985 in conjunction with Scanimate.\nWith the introduction of the Ampex Digital Optics (ADO) digital video system in late 1981, digital paint systems such as the Quantel Paint Box in 1982, and affordable 3D animation systems such as the Bosch FGS-4000 in 1983, the era of analog effects was rapidly phased out in the United States by the mid-1980s.\n',NULL,NULL,129,1,'2012-10-28 12:07:17','2012-10-28 12:07:18',NULL,NULL),(311,'how many scanimates?',3,'1980-01-01 00:00:00','Eight Scanimates had been built, six of which were in the United States.

Because Scanimate used a video CRT, optical devices such as star filters, shower glass, or rainbow filters could be placed in front of the lens to make the logos glow or twinkle.\nA Scanimate suite was much like a video-editing suite; image sources were combined through a video switcher using wipes, cross-dissolves, luminance keying, and chroma keying. Multiple images could be played back from multiple videotape machines through the switcher. Scanimate could be triggered to run in sync with any tape deck. (This was before the invention of VHS, Beta, or digital videotape. The professional video standard format at this time was reel-to-reel two-inch videotape!) Scanimate animation could be recorded on one tape machine, played back with another pass added on top, and then recorded to another machine.\nThese video techniques enabled Scanimate trickery to be used, for example, to create 3D gold flying logos. Here\'s the secret: An artist programmed Scanimate to create an undulating golden texture using oscillators patched into the INTENSITY parameter. (At Image West, we referred to this effect as \"Thrill-o-vision!\") A 3D logo, physically carved from balsa wood, was attached to a wooden dowel and connected to a stepper motor. The front surface of the carved logo was painted white, and the extruded sides were painted gray. The whole logo was then mounted in front of a chroma key blue background. Patching these signals into the video switcher, the artist defined the logo\'s white front surface as a luminance key hole. He then replaced it with the moving gold texture from Scanimate. Setting a different luminance key for the gray surfaces, he patched a darker gold texture into the extruded sides. He then created a streaking Scanimate star field and replaced the chroma key blue with that. The artist added another Scanimate pass to make the logo glow and used an Apple II computer to drive the motor to rotate the logo. VoilÃ¡! A 3D gold logo rotating through space! All this was recorded to tape in real time with the capability to change speeds, color, or motion as the client and art director supervised.\n',NULL,NULL,129,1,'2012-10-28 12:09:15','2012-10-28 12:09:17',NULL,NULL),(313,'Imagewest Scanimate demo - 1978',1,NULL,NULL,'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTO3CKM2Yy0','wTO3CKM2Yy0',NULL,1,'2012-10-28 12:11:27','2012-10-28 12:11:28',NULL,NULL),(314,'Interview with Lee Harrison',1,NULL,NULL,'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGF0Okaee1o','SGF0Okaee1o',NULL,1,'2012-10-28 12:15:14','2012-10-28 12:15:16',NULL,NULL),(315,'Scientific and Technical Academy Award',3,'1996-01-01 00:00:00','Ed Catmull, Tom Porter, Tom Duff, and Alvy Ray Smith received a Scientific and Technical Academy Award in 1996 from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) for \"pioneering inventions in digital image compositing\" (basically, for the invention of the alpha channel).',NULL,NULL,NULL,1,'2012-10-28 12:23:34','2012-10-28 12:23:35',NULL,NULL),(316,'Alvy Ray Smith',2,NULL,NULL,'http://alvyray.com/Bio/images/AlvyKingForbesASAP4x5.jpg',NULL,NULL,1,'2012-10-28 12:26:28','2012-10-28 12:26:30',NULL,NULL),(317,'Scientific and Engineering Award',3,'1999-01-01 00:00:00','In February 1999, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognized Discreet Logic\'s flame and inferno products for their influence on the advancement of the motion picture industry with a Scientific and Engineering Award.',NULL,NULL,NULL,1,'2012-10-28 12:43:30','2012-10-28 12:43:32',NULL,NULL),(318,'The End',3,'2000-01-01 00:00:00','Discreet Logic was acquired by Autodesk in 1999 for about $520 million in stock.
